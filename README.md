# Crosswording

This is a short beginners crosswording guide, taken from experience with the New York
Times crossword puzzle.

This guide isn't meant to be authoritative, but serves as a learning exercise
for its author, and hopefully, helps some people out there who are starting out
with crosswording.

Enjoy!
