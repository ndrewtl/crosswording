## Common Answers

Some letter combinations naturally occur more than others in crosswords, meaning
that a few answers inevitably appear in many, many puzzles. There are only a few
ways to devise clues for these answers, so they are usually easy to identify.

Knowing common answers can allow you to spot otherwise non-intuitive answers in
difficult situations (when was the last time you talked about Ugandan dictator
Idi Amin?) But when you get to know these common clues well, these can provide
the initial foothold on an otherwise-intractable puzzle.

Some common crossword answers:

  - `epee`

  - `amie`

  - `idi`

  - `nee`

  - `erg`

  - `ohm`
