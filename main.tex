\section{Common Answers}\label{common-answers}

Some letter combinations naturally occur more than others in crosswords,
meaning that a few answers inevitably appear in many, many puzzles.
There are only a few ways to devise clues for these answers, so they are
usually easy to identify.

Knowing common answers can allow you to spot otherwise non-intuitive
answers in difficult situations (when was the last time you talked about
Ugandan dictator Idi Amin?) But when you get to know these common clues
well, these can provide the initial foothold on an otherwise-intractable
puzzle.

Some common crossword answers:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  \texttt{epee}
\item
  \texttt{amie}
\item
  \texttt{idi}
\item
  \texttt{nee}
\item
  \texttt{erg}
\item
  \texttt{ohm}
\end{itemize}
